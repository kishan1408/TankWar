Tank War V1.0 is a game where you guide your tank to victory by destroying the targets. You accomplish this by choosing the optimum speed and angle that the missile will follow. The missile originates at the tank and will follow whatever speed and angle you lay out. The object of the game is to hit the target zone and to ultimately destroy the computer. The score bar is set to the middle position at beginning . The more accurately you hit the target you score points and the score bar increases. A missed target will penalize you and the score bar moves left. Your aim is to move the score bar to the extreme right. Then you WIN. If the score bar moves to the extreme left, you LOSE.Do not forget the air resistance !!
